# Get Shoutcast2 Stream Meta Data For Internet Radio Station Player
An alternative way to get meta data from a Shoutcast 2 stream. Although this system is being used in a production environment, please be aware that it is very much a work in progress. See it in use at https://tweetcast.blastfm.net

We are also getting images, based on the artist/track combination from our own Music Art API system. This is intended as an example of how you might get data from a stream and does not perfrom all of the functions needed for a player.

You may or may not need all of the variables in your application but I have included all of the available ones in index.php to show examples.

This is a free contribution. As radio station people, BlastFM Limited understand how difficult it is sometimes to find decent technical information about stream meta data and configurations. See index.php for more info and examples.

If you only want to get the current playing artist/track and are not interested in any other information, this is about the quickest and easiest way to do it, see: songInfo.php
