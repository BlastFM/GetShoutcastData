# GetShoutcastData
An alternative way to get meta data from a Shoutcast 2 stream. Although this system is being used in a production environment, please be aware that it is very much a work in progress. See it in use at https://tweetcast.blastfm.net

We are also getting images, based on the artist/track combination from our own Music Art API system. This is intended as an example of how you might get data from a stream and does not perfrom all of the functions needed for a player.
